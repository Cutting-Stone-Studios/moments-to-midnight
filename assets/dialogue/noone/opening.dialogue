: In the twilight of time, as the sun dipped below the horizon, a celestial message echoed through the minds of all living beings. It was a proclamation from the divine, an omniscient voice that resounded with an otherworldly clarity, leaving hearts pounding and souls trembling.
: "Behold, children of mortal realms," the voice of God declared, "the world as you know it shall come to an end in seven days' time."
: Amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, people paused in disbelief, their routines momentarily forgotten. The divine message reverberated through the collective consciousness, leaving no corner of the world untouched.
: In a small corner of this vast tapestry of existence, there lived a human, unaware of the monumental revelation that had just shaken the foundations of reality. As the first rays of dawn kissed the horizon, they stirred from slumber, unaware of the celestial decree that awaited them.
: Little did they know that their life was about to be forever altered, as the ticking of the cosmic clock counted down to an inevitable end. 
: In a world where time seemed to hasten, and darkness threatened to engulf all, a new chapter in the cosmic saga began. The human's fate, like that of every soul, was now intertwined with the grand design of the divine. And so, the clock started ticking, counting down the fleeting days.
