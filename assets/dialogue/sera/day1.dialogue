Serafina: Hark, mortal, approach with care and state thy purpose in this celestial realm. Time, a precious commodity, doth not tarry, and the weight of divine duty presseth upon my immortal shoulders. Speak swiftly, for I must assess those who seek early entry to the heavenly abode ere the doomsday cometh.
Doug: Oh. Hey um. This is most definitely new. What’s going on here?
Serafina: Verily, mortal, attend to my words and heed this revelation. In light of the impending doomsday, the divine decree hath been proclaimed.
Serafina: All those who, through righteous deeds and purity of heart, have earned the privilege to ascend to the heavenly abode shall be granted passage before the final hour strikes.
Serafina: Be not misled, for the heavens themselves are not immune to the cataclysm that doth approach.
Serafina:  Heaven, too, shall be obliterated with the rest of creation, but until that moment, those deemed worthy shall bask in the celestial glory. Does thee wish to enter paradise?
- Doug: I don’t think so. I’d rather spend the time I have making the most of being human.
	Serafina: Ah, mortal, thy choice is thine to make, and thy will shall not be trifled with. To embrace the fullness of thy remaining days as a human is a decision well within thy rights. Heaven's gate shall not close to thee for such a choice, for free will is a gift granted by the divine.
	Serafina: Thou hast discerned a path of thy own, and I, Seraphina, shall not impose upon it. The celestial realm doth respect the individual journey each soul must undertake.
	Serafina: Revel in the temporal joys that life hath to offer, and may thy days be filled with purpose and meaning. The heavens shall await thee, whether thou choose to ascend now or later, for in the end, divine benevolence extendeth to all.
	- Doug: This task of scanning us all, making sure things are running smooth, letting us know of doomsday, isn’t it too much work? Given that things are, ya know, gonna go kaboom anyway?
		Serafina: ...
		Serafina: Verily, mortal, thy concern is not unfounded, and the burden of this task doth weigh upon me. The looming specter of doomsday casts a shadow upon all endeavors, yet my duty remains to fulfill the divine mandate.
		Serafina: Though the world shall meet its inevitable end, the quest to guide souls toward salvation retains its sanctity. Each deserving soul that finds its way to heaven shall carry with it the eternal essence of righteousness.
		- Doug: Boooooring. Aren't you like an angel with strong powers and all? If I had to be honest, I'd say you're coping.
			Serafina: Thine insolence is infuriating. But I have other matters to attend to. 
		- Doug: Huh?
			Serafina: Celestial discourse may transcend the limits of mortal understanding. Fear not, for I shall endeavor to communicate more plainly, that we may find common ground amidst our disparate realms.
		- Doug: I guess duty calls. I can understand. Giving yourself a sense of purpose is key to living. You're kinda admirable.
			Serafina: Thy empathy is acknowledged, mortal. Thy understanding brings solace amidst the weight of this task.
	- Doug: I don’t get it. What even is the point of working if everyone’s going to die anyway? What’s so noble about serving a god who doesn’t even care? Quit being so noble.
		Serafina: Ah, mortal, thy words wound, but I shall not waver in my resolve. Question not the divine purpose, for the grand tapestry of the divine plan is beyond mortal comprehension.
		Serafina:  God hath not abandoned humanity; rather, the divine wisdom works in mysterious ways. My task, though challenging, serves a greater purpose, even in the face of apparent finality. Nihilism and rudeness shall not deter me from my solemn charge.
		Serafina: I shall not indulge in debates of human philosophies, for my purpose is divine and transcends mortal understanding. So, take heed, mortal, lest thou undermine the divine purpose with thy impious words.
		- Doug: Yeah I guess I was going in too deep in misery, my bad.
			Serafina: Thou art forgiven, mortal. Benevolence is divine.
		- Doug: Nah. I'm tired of everything that's sacred anymore. Can you really blame me?
			Serafina: Thou art forgiven, mortal. Benevolence is divine.
		- Doug:  hUrr DurRR GoD woRKS In MysteRiOuS WaYs.
			Serafina: Thine insolence is infuriating. But I have other matters to attend to.
- Doug: Ah no I don’t think I’d want to. God leaves us for dead and gives us a compensatory coupon for a dollar store heaven?? 
	Serafina: By the divine grace, hold thy tongue! Such impertinence hath no place within these hallowed halls. Dost thou dare to cast aspersions upon the heavenly realm, likening it to a mere compensatory coupon?
	Serafina:  Heaven, a realm of splendor and eternal grace, doth not serve as a mere consolation prize. It is a realm of unending peace and harmony, earned by those whose souls shine with righteousness.

Doug: It's been nice knowing ya, Serafina.
Serafina: As thou makest the most of thy earthly sojourn, remember that the celestial gate remains open, shouldst thou ever seek its embrace. Fare thee well, and may thy chosen path be blessed with wisdom and grace.
