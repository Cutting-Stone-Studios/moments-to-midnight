<h3>What's coming?</h3>
We've got plenty in-store. Unfortunately, making games that tell a complex story is difficult in such a short time. As we developed this for the 2023 Summer Slow Jam: Narrative, we started late and at times had scattered brains. All-in-all, a great learning experience for our team.
<br><br>
Stay tuned for more updates, we'll be releasing more to the story, introducing new characters, and enhancing gameplay with new features and mechanics over the coming weeks!
